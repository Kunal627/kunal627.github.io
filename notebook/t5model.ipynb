    "* T5 uses \"Relative Positional Encoding\" T5 employs relative positional encodings to capture the relationship between tokens in a sequence, rather than their absolute positions. This means that the model focuses on how tokens relate to each other, regardless of their specific position in the input sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I think T5 uses RMSNorm for layer normalization. And for boosting performance it uses apex.normalization.FusedRMSNorm instead of T5LayerNorm (Source. Huggingface). I have tried to write a simple implementation of RMS Norm\n",
    "\n",
    "* The T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model employs a unified framework for various NLP tasks by casting all tasks as a text-to-text problem. This approach allows it to apply the same model architecture and training objective across different tasks, making it versatile and powerful.
