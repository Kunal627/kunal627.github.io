    "#### Setting Up Qdrant Vector Database on Docker Locally\n",
    "\n",
    "In this blog post, we will look at setting up Qdrant, a high-performance vector similarity search engine, using Docker on your local machine. Qdrant is designed to handle large-scale vector data and provides efficient and scalable solutions for similarity search. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a fully functional Qdrant instance running locally, ready to be integrated into your applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Qdrant?\n",
    "\n",
    "Qdrant “is a vector similarity search engine that provides a production-ready service with a convenient API to store, search, and manage points (i.e. vectors) with an additional payload.” You can think of the payloads as additional pieces of information that can help you hone in on your search and also receive useful information that you can give to your users.\n",
